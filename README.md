------------------------------------------Ceaser Cipher------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.

More complex encryption schemes such as the Vigen√®re cipher employ the Caesar cipher as one element of the encryption process. The widely known ROT13 'encryption' is simply a Caesar cipher with an offset of 13. The Caesar cipher offers essentially no communication security, and it will be shown that it can be easily broken even by hand.

---------------------------------------------Monoalphabetic cipher------------------------------------------------------------------------
Substitution ciphers are probably the most common form of cipher. They work by replacing each letter of the plaintext (and sometimes puntuation marks and spaces) with another letter (or possibly even a random symbol).

A monoalphabetic substitution cipher, also known as a simple substitution cipher, relies on a fixed replacement structure. That is, the substitution is fixed for each letter of the alphabet. Thus, if "a" is encrypted to "R", then every time we see the letter "a" in the plaintext, we replace it with the letter "R" in the ciphertext.
A simple example is where each letter is encrypted as the next letter in the alphabet: "a simple message" becomes "B TJNQMF NFTTBHF". In general, when performing a simple substitution manually, it is easiest to generate the ciphertext alphabet first, and encrypt by comparing this to the plaintext alphabet. The table below shows how one might choose to, and we will, lay them out for this example.

--------------------------------------------Playfair cipher-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but was named after Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher. The technique encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher. The Playfair is significantly harder to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it. Frequency analysis can still be undertaken, but on the 25*25=625 possible digraphs rather than the 25 possible monographs. Frequency analysis thus requires much more ciphertext in order to work. For a tutorial on breaking Playfair with a simulated annealing algorithm, see Cryptanalysis of the Playfair Cipher.

It was used for tactical purposes by British forces in the Second Boer War and in World War I and for the same purpose by the Australians during World War II. This was because Playfair is reasonably fast to use and requires no special equipment. A typical scenario for Playfair use would be to protect important but non-critical secrets during actual combat. By the time the enemy cryptanalysts could break the message the information was useless to them.

-----------------------------------------Polyalphabetic Cipher--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The development of Polyalphabetic Substitution Ciphers was the cryptographers answer to Frequency Analysis. The first known polyalphabetic cipher was the Alberti Cipher invented by Leon Battista Alberti in around 1467. He used a mixed alphabet to encrypt the plaintext, but at random points he would change to a different mixed alphabet, indicating the change with an uppercase letter in the ciphertext. In order to utilise this cipher, Alberti used a cipher disc to show how plaintext letters are related to ciphertext letters.
For example, when the disc on the left is set as shown, we see that the plaintext letter "e" (on the outside ring) is encrypted to "Z" (on the inside ring).
Alberti would use this setting for a few letters of the message, and then rotate the inner disc to a different setting for the next few letters, and so on.
